refactoring:
migration to sdl 2.0
made less global variables - they are class attributes now
time is shown correctly
fixed wrong spelling ("Coardinate" instead of correct "coordinate")
minor: 
	"for cycle" at the beginning of load_files() now has 2 iterations instead of 3 - the third is useless
	added "YOU WIN" message instead of "GAME OVER" on successful walkthrough of the game
	load_layer now uses no arguments because no were actually used
	misleading comments
